Problems with cash: 
        The browsers stores the information
        for quick reloading for the next access,
        but the page checks the file name, not
        the content, what can cause out-of-date
        problems

    Solution:
        We add a hash to file name in webpack, then
        we download a plugin:
            * yarn add html-webpack-plugin -D
        
        In package.json we import the plugin, like this: 
            -> const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); <-
        Next, we create a property called plugins, and within that property, 
        we create an instance like this:
            -> new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
                template: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'),
            }),
        To finish, we reload the yarn build in cmd

Problems with file creation:
        When we add automatic hashing, many files are created

    Solution:
        We install another plugin in webpack, in cmd:
            -> yarn add clean-webpack-plugin -D
        Then, access the webpack file and add 
            -> const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');
        In the plugins property, add:
            -> new CleanWebpackPlugin(), 
                *obs: no argument needs to be passed
        To finish, we reload the yarn build in cmd
